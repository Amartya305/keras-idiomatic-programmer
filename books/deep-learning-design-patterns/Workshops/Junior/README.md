## Overview

This section on the workshop bundles for the Deep Learning Design Patterns Primer. 
Each workshop covers one chapter and consists of a presentation that summarizes the chapter along with one or more 
lab exercises. The intended audience is junior -- recent undergraduate or coding school grad in datascience, or ML practictioner with
under 18 months of experience.
