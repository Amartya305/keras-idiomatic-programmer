## Overview

This section on the workshop bundles for the Deep Learning Design Patterns Primer. Each workshop covers one chapter and consists of a presentation that summarizes the chapter along with one or more lab exercises. The intended audience is novice -- experienced with Python but only minimal knowledge/experience with Deep Learning.
